# Overview of submitted results

A total of 45 groups signed the participation agreement for the SPE11. Of these, 18 groups submitted valid data of sufficient quality for inclusion in the comparative study; these groups will be referred to hereafter as the “participants” of SPE11. An additional two groups submitted data that were deemed unphysical and were subsequently excluded from the study.

Each participant was allowed to submit up to four sets of results, and partial submissions— including only one or two of the subcases—were also accepted. As a result, 13 participants submitted a total of 21 results to SPE11A, all 18 participants submitted a total of 34 results to SPE11B, while 14 participants submitted a total of 22 results to SPE11C. Table 2 provides an overview of the participating groups.
